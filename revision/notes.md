## Referee 1
Review litterature in intro. In particular: 
- The mathematical literature contains contains many examples under the name tree stochastic processes.
- Knowles, Ghahramani "Pitman Yor diffusion trees"
- evolution of gene expression levels (continuous variables). Work by Khaitovich may be interesting, a detailed inference method using an OU-type model appears in "Pervasive adaptation of gene expression in Drosophila" (Nourmohammad et al., 2015) 

Problem with Fig. 2: caption does not say what $x$-axis is.
